    <h1> Who are Elani?</h1>
    <img class="image" src="pic.1.jpg" height="400" width="400">
    <p> Elani is a Kenyan Afro Pop band from Nairobi consisting of three members;Wambui Ngugi,Maureen Kungu and Brian Chweya.
   Since their debut to the music industry in November 2013 with the song <a href="https://youtu.be/Ej_QYoQVSnw" target="_self"> "Jana Usiku"</a>they have been able to maintain a distinct music career to-date.Because not only have they been able to be nominated in the channel O music video Awards as most Gifted-East but also win an award at All Africa Music Award (AFRIMA) as best African pop band.My Favourite albums are;barua ya Dunia,colours of love,elani instrumentals,Digital Me,Ayin,Speaking in Cursive.Their taste and style of music makes them indifferent which i guess makes them my favourite band. </p>
